Hi there! I'm Dimitris Rammos, a Software Engineer based in Athens, Greece, and I'm close to completing my studies in the [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/), specializing in **computer science**. My passion for technology drives me to constantly explore and deepen my knowledge in various programming languages and software development techniques.

With experience in **Rust**, **C#**, **Java**, and **C/C++**, I enjoy working on backend development and creating efficient, scalable solutions. My skill set includes using a variety of development tools and frameworks to build robust applications and collaborate effectively within **Agile** teams. I’m fascinated by emerging technologies, and my goal is to contribute to impactful projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible in **software engineering**.

Looking to the future, I’m open to opportunities in several fields, particularly **blockchain development** and **automotive software engineering**, as both areas align with my interest in advanced, innovative technologies. I’m also keen on expanding my career and academic pursuits **internationally**, as I believe working abroad would provide invaluable insights and experiences that would further enhance my skills and broaden my perspective.

In my free time, I enjoy balancing my tech interests with activities like going to the gym, boxing, and spending time with friends. I find that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for staying motivated and creative in my work.

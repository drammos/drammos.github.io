Welcome to **Game of Life**, a Conway's Game of Life implementation created by **Dimitrios Rammos** as part of the **Data Structures** course in the **Department of Informatics and Telecommunications (DIT)** at the **University of Athens**. This project is developed in **C** and demonstrates advanced usage of data structures and algorithms.

## 📜 Introduction

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state without requiring further input. This implementation allows users to input patterns in the `.rle` format and outputs the evolution of the game as a GIF animation.

  - `ship-in-a-bottle.rle`
  - `breeder-1.rle`
  - `gospergundestroyedbygliders.rle`
  - `new-gun-1.rle`
  - `p24shuttleshasslingoctagon2.rle`
  - `p29pentadecathlonhassler.rle`
  - `ship-in-a-bottle.rle`
  - `two-glider.rle`

- **include/**: Header files for modularization, including:
  - `ADTList.h`, `ADTMap.h`, `ADTVector.h`: Custom data structure implementations.
  - `bmp.h`, `gif.h`: Helpers for generating output images and animations.
  - `LifeState.h`: Core game logic definitions.

- **modules/**: C source files implementing the logic of the headers in `include/`.

- **program/**: Contains the main program logic:
  - `lifegame.c`: Main entry point for the application.
  - `Makefile`: Build instructions.
  - `output.gif`: Generated GIF of the game’s evolution.

## 🔧 Input/Output Description

### Input:
- Input files are located in the `files/` directory.
- Each file is in `.rle` (Run-Length Encoded) format, which describes initial patterns for the game grid.

### Output:
- A single file named `output.gif` is generated, which visualizes the evolution of the game.

## 🗂️ Code Highlights

### `LifeState.c`
The core logic of the Game of Life, including:
- **Grid Initialization:** Reads `.rle` files to initialize the game grid.
- **Rules Implementation:** Applies Conway's rules to compute the next generation.
- **State Management:** Tracks and updates cells efficiently using custom data structures.


### `LifeGame.c`
The main entry point for the program:
- **Input Handling:** Reads user-specified input patterns.
- **Game Execution:** Executes the game logic using `LifeState`.
- **Output Generation:** Outputs the results as an animated GIF.
